# Predicting income using 1994 Census Data
### Predicting income using 1994 Census Data


## Introduction

The focus of this project is on predicting if an individual makes more than $50,000 a year using census data from 1994. Building on that I also want to know what variables are most impactful in determing whether an individual makes more than 50k a year. The data used in this project was taken from the 1994 Census Database and was provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. To predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000 a year I used traditional statistical modeling- logistic regression and machine learning techniques such as Neural networks, Random Forest and Support Vector machines. This project is done in R and uses the packages: `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `dplyr`, `class`, `tree`, `randomForest`,  `ROCR`, `kernlab`, `rpart`, `nnet` .
